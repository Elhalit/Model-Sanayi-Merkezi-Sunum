# 🌟 Advanced Animated Synergy Constellation - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 **Revolutionary Partnership Visualization**

We've successfully transformed the basic partnership diagram into a **living, breathing constellation** that tells the story of how İNNO Gayrimenkul, Nadir Metal Rafineri, NET İnşaat, and SOM Prefabrik came together in 2017.

## 🚀 **The Four-Phase Animation Sequence**
